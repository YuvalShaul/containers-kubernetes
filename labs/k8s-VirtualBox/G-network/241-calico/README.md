# 241 - Calico Operation

We'll use this lab to get a glimpse of the calico networking plugin.

- [Network Namespaces](#Network-Namespaces)
- [Show networking inside a pod](#Show-networking-inside-a-pod)


## Create some pods and inspect scheduling

- The **netpods.yaml** file from this lab creates many pods.
- Apply the file:  
**kubectl apply -f netpods.yaml**
- Several of these pods will be scheduled to our test node (I'll be using k8s-c).  
Find how many of those have landed in the testing node:  
**kubectl get pods -o wide | grep k8s-c | wc -l**

## Network Namespaces

- We would like to take a look at the networking inside the test node:  
**ssh osboxes@192.168.122.13**
- The Calico plugin will create a [networking namespace](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html) for each pod scheduled to run here:  
**ip netns list**  (you can ommit the last word)
- Calico configures the node to connect between these namespaces.  
Use the **ip addess show** (or **ip a sh**) to view the interfaces coming from the pods, and the tunnel connecting them at the node namespace.

## Show networking inside a pod

- You can exec into a pod, and then use networking commands inside:
  - **ip a sh**
  - **tcpdump**  (to see network traffic)
- You can see the same from the node cli level:
  - **sudo ip netns exec \<net namespace\>  ip a sh**  
  Example:  
sudo ip netns exec cni-03e58a9e-e9b5-b071-20df-968bcd8abc3d  ip a sh
  - **sudo ip netns exec \<net namespace\>  tcpdump**
