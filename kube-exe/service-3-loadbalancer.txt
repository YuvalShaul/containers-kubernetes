1. So far so good; but, we do not expect the users to know the IP addresses of our worker nodes.
    Either..
        Recreate your service:
            kubectl delete svc nginx
            kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
        or
        Edit your sercie, and change the type:
            kubectl edit service nginx

    Verify that the type has changed:
        kubectl get svc

    Note that you still do not have an external IP address (you see <pending>)

2. For minikube:
    Services of type LoadBalancer can be exposed via the minikube tunnel command.
    It must be run in a separate terminal window to keep the LoadBalancer running.
    Ctrl-C in the terminal can be used to terminate the process at which time
    the network routes will be cleaned up.

    So:
        minikube tunnel   (you may need to use your sudo credentials)
    Now go back to see the state of your service:
        kubectl get service

    You should see you have an external IP address.

    Use:
        ip route sh
        to see the route that will take your traffic to the service.

3. Try the service:
        curl 10.104.56.113 | grep h1

4. Don't delete anything, and continue from here to the next exercise: service-4-high-availability.txt
