1. Delete all minikube objects:
     minikube delete --all

2. Start a minikube cluster with 3 nodes:
    minikube start --nodes 3
    verify that you have 3 nodes, and get their IP addresses

3. Create a deployment based on the kuard image, but request only 1 replica (pod)
    kubectl create deployment alpaca-prod --image=gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue --replicas=1 --port=8080
    On what node does it run?

4. Create a service based on the deployment you have created
    Use the "expose" command

5. Verify that the service was created.

6. Create a NodePort by editing the service configuration:
    Change the spec/type to NodePort

7, Find the new NodePort created by Kubernetes for the service:
    kubectl describe service alpaca-prod

8. Brose the NodePort port, but from an IP address of a node with no pods in it:
    You should be able to see the application from all node IP addresses (no port-forward)
