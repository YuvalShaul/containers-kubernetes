1. This exercise continue the previous exercise: clusterip-service.txt

2. Choose how to change the service type:
    2-a.  Delete the created service and recreate it:
            kubectl get svc
            kubectl delete svc nginx
        This time, create it with a different type:
            kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type NodePort

    2-b. Alternatively, edit the service object and change the type to NodePort.
        kubectl edit service nginx
        (find the type, change the value to NodePort, save and exit)


3. Verify that the service type is now ok.
    kubectl get service

    Notice that we still don't have an external IP, but we now have an extra port number for this pod.
    If we know the external IP address of our nodes, we can connect to this port in any node, even in nodes
    where there are no pods that belong to the service.


4. Find the IP addresses of all nodes:
        kubectl get nodes -o wide
   You can even verify where you pod is actually running:
        kubectl get pods -o wide

5. Fetch some data from the nginx service, from several nodes (including ones that have no nginx pod:
    Example:
        curl -s 192.168.49.2:31415 | grep h1
        curl -s 192.168.49.3:31415 | grep h1
        curl -s 192.168.49.4:31415 | grep h1
        curl -s 192.168.49.5:31415 | grep h1

6. Use the get service command again:
    kubectl get service
    Do you understand more fields now?
